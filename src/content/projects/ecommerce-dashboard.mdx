# E-Commerce Dashboard

A modern, high-performance dashboard built to help retailers make data-driven decisions.

## Problem
Retailers struggle to visualize their sales data in real-time across multiple channels.

## Solution
We built a unified dashboard that aggregates data from Shopify, WooCommerce, and custom APIs into a single view.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Analytics**: WebSocket integration for live updates.
- **Custom Reports**: Drag-and-drop report builder.
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme switching.

## Technical Details
This project was built using **Next.js 14** to leverage server components for faster initial page loads. We used **Recharts** for the complex data visualizations.
